# Qwen3.8-27B QUASAR QAT NVFP4 for NInfer

> **Artifact version:** This card preserves the published v2 release, its original
> section structure, hashes, measurements and reproduction history. Current NInfer
> uses v3 artifacts; the legacy engine-registration and run instructions below
> describe the v2 engine, not the current recipe interface. See the
> [v3 conversion and reproduction guide](reproduction.md) for the maintained
> recipe. A new conversion is not covered by the release checksum or quality
> results below; its optional W8 DFlash2 component is not the released NVFP4 module.

This model card is the version-controlled source for [cometkim/Qwen3.8-27B-nvfp4qat-NInfer](https://huggingface.co/cometkim/Qwen3.8-27B-nvfp4qat-NInfer).

The repository contains a QAT-sourced NVFP4 weight profile of [Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B) in the native [NInfer](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer) `.ninfer` artifact format, with the [z-lab/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2](https://huggingface.co/z-lab/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2) block-diffusion speculative drafter embedded in the same image. The artifact is intended only for NInfer engines with [cometkim/ninfer](https://github.com/cometkim/ninfer) patches; it is not a Transformers checkpoint, Safetensors distribution, or GGUF file.

## Weight profile

This is a fourth weight profile for the existing `qwen3_8_27b` target — a peer of the official `groupwise-int` and `nvfp4` profiles and of the fork's fuller-requant [`nvfp4full`](https://huggingface.co/cometkim/Qwen3.8-27B-nvfp4full-NInfer) profile.

The Text weight stack is copied **word-for-word** from [QUASAR-QAT/Qwen3.8-27B-QUASAR-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/QUASAR-QAT/Qwen3.8-27B-QUASAR-NVFP4) — a quantization-aware-trained checkpoint (QUASAR loss-aware NVFP4 distillation against the frozen BF16 teacher, arXiv 2608.13966):
- every one of the 496 text linear layers is NVFP4 (W4A4) — attention, gated-delta-net, and MLP alike, with no high-precision exceptions;
- the QAT factory quantizes per site, so every constituent tensor of a fused parent shares one weight and input global scale; the converter enforces that sharing before copying a word, and the site input divisors ride the artifact directly;
- the GDN control projections are decoded from their QAT NVFP4 words to the BF16 control parent the engine consumes.

Everything else comes from the official BF16 base exactly as the fork's `nvfp4full` profile builds it: the W8 embedding and output head, the optimized draft head, MTP, Vision, and the frontend. The converter proves the routing complete by byte-comparing every unquantized QAT tensor against the official source (703 tensors, bit-identical). The complete contract is [`docs/maintainer/qwen3.8-27b-artifact.md` §15 in the fork](https://github.com/cometkim/ninfer/blob/91f8a447e3d53f764c30116d7df53c5b4e213511/docs/maintainer/qwen3.8-27b-artifact.md#15-fork-artifact-nvfp4qat).

## DFlash2 speculative drafter

The artifact carries the fork's DFlash2 companion module — the 2B-parameter masked block-diffusion drafter of [z-lab/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2](https://huggingface.co/z-lab/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2), five layers, sliding window 2048, selector rank 256 / top-16 — as 66 further objects, so `--spec dflash2` needs no second file.

Upstream's registered schema stores the module's matrices as W8G32_F16S. This image stores the 34 drafter matrices weight-only NVFP4 instead (norms and conv base kernels stay BF16), shrinking the module payload from 2,226,805,248 to 1,082,882,820 bytes (−1.07 GiB); Text weights are byte-identical between the two encodings.

On the conversion-verification workload the NVFP4 module drafted 2.50 tokens/round at 21.4% acceptance for this profile, against 5.50 tokens/round at 64.3% for `nvfp4full` in the same workload.

## Engine support

Upstream [Neroued/ninfer](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer) rejects this artifact as-is.

Some patches from [cometkim/ninfer](https://github.com/cometkim/ninfer) required to make it run on other NInfer engines, for example [natpate/ninfer-windows](https://github.com/natpate/ninfer-windows).

**1. Weights-profile registration.** NInfer accepts an artifact only when its `model_id`/`weights_id` pair resolves in the target's compile-time registered set (`Package::resolve_weights` in `src/targets/qwen3_6_27b/impl/package.cpp`); upstream registers only `groupwise-int` and `nvfp4` for `qwen3.8-27b` and throws on every other identity.
**2. NVFP4-encoded DFlash2 module execution.** Upstream DFlash2 executes its companion module with `W8G32_F16S` matrices; this image's module is NVFP4-encoded (see above), which needs the NVFP4 execution routes.

The minimal patch set is therefore:

| layer | branch | carries |
|---|---|---|
| module execution | [`feat/dflash2`](https://github.com/cometkim/ninfer/tree/feat/dflash2) | NVFP4 DFlash2 module execution behind one binder contract, self-contained on the Windows build layer |
| profile registration | [`feat/qwen3.8-nvfp4qat`](https://github.com/cometkim/ninfer/tree/feat/qwen3.8-nvfp4qat) | the `nvfp4qat` identity, converter/verifier, artifact contract, this card |

`feat/qwen3.8-nvfp4qat` is stacked directly on `feat/dflash2`, which itself carries only the Windows/MSVC build layer besides upstream master. The sibling [`feat/qwen3.8-nvfp4full`](https://github.com/cometkim/ninfer/tree/feat/qwen3.8-nvfp4full) branch registers the fuller-requant profile the same way.

The long-context and KV-codec cells in this card additionally use two fork capabilities that are **not** part of the minimal patch set — the `hq-e8-2b` KV codec (~9× denser than INT8 group-64) and YaRN rope scaling — which ride the fork's `feat/hyperquant` and `feat/1m-context` branches or its `cometkim/dev` integration branch.

| capability | minimal patch set | full fork |
|---|---|---|
| Text / Vision / MTP / DFlash2, CLI and OpenAI/Anthropic serving | ✓ | ✓ |
| KV storage | bf16, int8, fp8, nvfp4, k8v4 | + hq-e8-2b |
| context envelope | native 262,144 | + YaRN 524,288 / 786,432 / 1,048,576 |

You can get full capability by using `cometkim/dev` branch that integrated all fork's own experiments.

## Run with NInfer

Any engine carrying the two patches above runs this artifact; the reference engine is the [cometkim/ninfer](https://github.com/cometkim/ninfer) fork (integration branch `cometkim/dev`). Windows (MSVC + CUDA 13.1+) or 64-bit Linux, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 (`sm_120a`).

## Size and quality

### Device weights

The artifact is 17.35 GiB on disk.

Device weights depend on the startup option, which is optional and fixed for the process lifetime.

The MTP lane adds 0.42 GiB and the DFlash2 lane 1.01 GiB. `--vision` adds the 333-object Vision tower (295,711,648 bytes = 0.275 GiB) identically in every lane; the KV cache (`--kv-dtype`) and workspace are allocated on top.

| Device weights | no Vision | with `--vision` |
|---|---:|---:|
| no speculation | 15.31 GiB | 15.59 GiB |
| `--spec mtp` | 15.73 GiB | 16.01 GiB |
| `--spec dflash2` | 16.32 GiB | 16.60 GiB |

KV pool bytes at the native 262,144-token capacity (per-token geometry is shared by every weights profile of this target):

| KV dtype | pool @ 262,144 tokens | per token |
|---|---:|---:|
| `bf16` | 16.00 GiB (derived) | 65,536 B |
| `int8` | 8.25 GiB | 33,792 B |
| `fp8` | 8.06 GiB | 33,024 B |
| `k8v4` | 6.28 GiB | 25,728 B |
| `nvfp4` | 4.50 GiB | 18,432 B |
| `hq-e8-2b` | 2.28 GiB | 9,352 B |

The bf16 row is derived from the exact 8.00 GiB pool measured at 131,072 tokens (65,536 B/token); a full 262,144-token bf16 pool does not fit beside the weights.

### Model baseline — INT8 group-64 KV, native 262,144 context

Measured on one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 through the registered serving profile (thinking, 0-shot, rule scoring; the reasoning suites run MTP3 at the full output head on INT8 KV with the native 262,144-token context, temperature 0.6, top_p 0.95, top_k 20; three independent seed rounds).

LongBench v2 runs full-capability mode — thinking on under the same sampling and seed rounds, rule-scored on the final `ANSWER: [LETTER]` line with a 16,384-token output budget, under its RoPE profiles: short at native 262,144, medium at 524,288 (YaRN factor 2), long at 786,432 (YaRN factor 3).

| Benchmark | Score |
|---|---:|
| GPQA-Diamond (3-round mean) | 89.22 ± 2.49 |
| AIME 2026 (3-round mean) | 91.11 ± 3.85 |
| LongBench v2 short (3-round mean) | 66.30 ± 0.85 |

### Engine-specific `hq-e8-2b` cells — long-context envelope and KV-codec A/B

> **What `hq-e8-2b` is and why it exists.** [HyperQuant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.23406): A ~2.25-bit E8-lattice + Rice KV cache codec with a BF16 sink-plus-recent residual window, built into NInfer's fork (no vLLM/llama.cpp equivalent)
> It exists because of a hard memory constraint: on the 32 GB RTX 5090 the ≈15.3 GiB of device weights leave room for at most ~262k tokens of INT8 group-64 KV, so the 524k and 786k envelopes only fit at hq's ~9× smaller per-key footprint.
> Quality is not the compromise the bit-width suggests: paired same-prompt campaigns measured hq-vs-INT8 parity at 390–400k contexts (McNemar p ≈ 0.49) with exact needle retrieval out to 592k tokens.

| Benchmark | KV cache | Context / RoPE | Score |
|---|---|---|---:|
| GPQA-Diamond (seed 42) | hq-e8-2b | native 262,144 | 90.91 |
| AIME 2026 (seed 42) | hq-e8-2b | native 262,144 | 96.67 |
| LongBench v2 short | hq-e8-2b | native 262,144 | 66.67 |
| LongBench v2 medium | hq-e8-2b | 524,288 · YaRN 2 | 56.90 ± 2.56 |
| LongBench v2 long | hq-e8-2b | 786,432 · YaRN 3 | 39.50 ± 0.53 |

The A/B rows are paired runs: identical prompts, seed, and envelope as the INT8 baseline rows above, with only the KV dtype changed, isolating the codec's effect per benchmark.

The LBv2 medium and long rows cannot pair as INT8 KV does not fit beside the weights at those envelopes.

## Reproduce

Conversion and bit-level verification (sources: the official BF16 checkpoint, the QUASAR QAT checkpoint, the z-lab DFlash2 BF16 drafter):

```bash
python3 -m tools.convert.qwen3_8_27b.convert_nvfp4qat \
  --model /path/to/Qwen3.8-27B \
  --quantized-model /path/to/Qwen3.8-27B-QUASAR-NVFP4 \
  --dflash2-model /path/to/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2 \
  --out out/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4qat.ninfer
python3 -m tools.convert.qwen3_8_27b.verify_nvfp4qat out/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4qat.ninfer \
  --model /path/to/Qwen3.8-27B \
  --quantized-model /path/to/Qwen3.8-27B-QUASAR-NVFP4 \
  --dflash2-model /path/to/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2
```

`verify_nvfp4qat` checks all 256 QAT payloads word-for-word, the 256 site divisors, the 48 decoded control parents against the independent decode oracle, the DFlash2 module against a reference re-encode, and the weight-divisor derivation cross-check `d_w = binary32(2688/amax)`.

Evaluation — GPQA-Diamond + AIME26 on the INT8 baseline lane, the same suites on the `hq-e8-2b` KV lane (the codec A/B cells), and the LongBench v2 RoPE cells:

```bash
eval/run_card_quality.sh models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4qat.ninfer nvfp4qat int8 42 43 44
eval/run_card_quality.sh models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4qat.ninfer nvfp4qat hq-e8-2b 42 43 44

## Limits

Multi-seed benchmark results under the stated profiles, not pass@k.

The profile is a re-source of the QUASAR QAT checkpoint, not an independent QAT run; its quality ceiling is theirs. The GDN control parents are the BF16 materialization of the QAT NVFP4 words (one rounding).

The QUASAR organization is new (first published checkpoint August 2026); every quality claim here is re-measured locally rather than taken from their card.
